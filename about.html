        <p>
          A few months ago I realised that it was time for a change. Working in
          the medical field was very rewarding. However, after my second back
          injury and one back surgery, I realised it was time I persued another
          interest I have always had but thought was out of reach, web
          development!

      <p class="para-title">How I stay commited to learning</p>
      <p>
        I am always learning, and for a while it felt like my brain was in
        overdrive. I realized coding is not something that you can pound into
        your brain, it is something you have to take bit by bit.
      </p>
      <p>So what keeps me going?</p>
      <p>
        Well other than needing to in order to get a good job, it is the
        gratification of completing a module and practicing a skill until I can
        say 'OH, I can do this!'.
      </p>
      <p class="para-title">How I got started</p>
      <p>
        Well, it started out as googling and watching YouTube videos about
        front-end development. From there I tried a few different courses and
        landed on a combination of Scrimba and Udemy.
